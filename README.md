# scaryzombies
A simple Fabric mod that aims to make zombies scarier. Inspired by Shotbow's MineZ plugin.
I'm making this mod for my custom modpack.

**This mod is currently in pre-alpha, and is not survival-ready.**

## Planned:
- Add config file
- Add textures
- Upload on CurseForge and Modrinth
- Update to 1.18
- Balance speed, damage, and TTK of zombies
- Improve zombie behavior and pathfinding
  - Change player detection (crouching and crawling players are not detected)
  - Improve zombie "charge state" (moves faster when detecting a player)
  - Calls nearby zombies to swarm
  - Implement 1.18 Sculk methods to have zombies detect "noise"
